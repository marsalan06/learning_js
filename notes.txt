js
1) create an html file to apply js over 
2) <script> tags are used to sperate js from any other lanaguage code 
3) essentially js files are kept seprate but we'll start from same page 
4) script tags are palced to keep the js code in them, the console.log function is like the print
function for the terminal but in browsers its called a console and log means write to the console
5) ; is used in js to indicate a end of line instruction like in c 
6)document.write is used to display anything on the html page it self, similar as jinja, we can
place html tags in it 
7) we can raise warning and errors for the console through console.warn and console.error 
8) but js code without semicolon works is because it has automatic semicolon insertion feature with
it, but as a good programmer you should place semicolon your self

How to change html tag values
1) using document.getElementById method we can get the particual tag if a id is asigned to that tag
2) and to change the tag contents we can use .innerHTML method to the previous js funtion and place
a new value to the tag, we can use document.write(document.getElementById()) to directly write to 
the html, getElementById().style.color="red" changes color of the tag content

3)comment in js //, for multiline comment \* */, now we'll use the <input> tag to get user input 
    in innerHTML and change it by using js, to show the value of the input tag through innerHTML 
    we need a function because the code is read line by line 
4) errors in the js code can be seen on the console


variables and data types:
primitive data types: 
    a) string "this is @ strIng", 'this !$ @ls0 @ Str|nG'
    b) number 1,2,3,4.6666,3.14,-.22222 all are number , their is no int or float discrimnation
    c) boolean true / false only , True /False are not boolean
    d)undefined is a type, when a variable is created but not assigned value its called undefined
        var demo;
        alert(demo); //shows undefined
        alert(typeof demo); //shows undefined 
    e) null is an object, while null is assigned to be refreneced same as in python, 
        var demo = null;
        alert(demo); //shows null
        alert(typeof demo); //shows object
    
variables:
    --> var key word is used in js as c
        var x = 6;
        console.log(x); or document.write(x);
        x=9; reasigns the x to the value 9 
    variable names should be meaningfull and shouldnt have spaces , so my_name , cant start with numbers
    , these can be camel cases, variables arent binded to a data type
        --> var x= 6; //is an number variable 
            var name= "Arsalan" //is a string variable
            x=name; //reasigns x (previous num) to a string variable to store a string 
    
logical and assignment operators 
we can + -*/ and % (remainder) 2 numbers, a "string" + 1 (num) will result in concatination "string1"
increament operator is x+=1 and so on, this increament can work on string as well 
    var x= "hi";
    x+="hi";
    console.log(x)
        => "hihi"
boolean comparision , var x=10; var y=12; var b= x>=y; //test if x is greater than or equal to y 
                    console.log(b) // returns false 

equal comparision operator are of two type , one that compares value a variable holds while the other 
not only comapres the value but the type as well (c1), opposite is != for == and !== for === ,
logical and && logical or ||, bitwise and & bitwise or |, not is !

functions:
function (keyword) add (name of function) (*args,**kwargs){
    function operations happen here  
    return statement;
}
functions can be called as variables var x=add();


if else:
if(){
    conditon;
}
else if (){
    conditon;
}

else{
    conditon;
}
getElementById("").value; can be stored in a variable to compare
multiple if's will waste computation cycle in case of any one true because all if's 
will be checked while else if will be checked for only one true instance
